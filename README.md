# Machine Learning Projects Repository

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Here, I've compiled several machine learning projects that showcase various predictive modeling techniques and data analysis methods. Below is a brief overview of each project:

## Predicting House Prices with Gradient Boosting
Utilizing gradient boosting techniques, this project aims to predict house prices. The model employed for this task is gradient boosting.

## Predicting Molecular Solubility for Drug Viability
In the pursuit of developing effective medications, predicting the solubility of molecules is crucial for biologists and chemists. This notebook tackles the task of predicting molecular solubility using machine learning techniques.

**Machine Learning Models Used:**
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest

## Predicting Tip Size with Linear Regression and K-means Clustering Enhanced by GPT Analysis
This project focuses on predicting the size of tips using a combination of machine learning models and large language models.

**Models Used:**
- Linear Regression: For predictive modeling
- K-Means Clustering: Identifying underlying patterns in the data
- GPT-3.5: Integrated with K-means clustering for in-depth analysis of the clusters

## Logistic Regression and GPT Analysis
In this notebook, the task involves classifying penguin species based on various physical attributes using logistic regression.
And then further analysis using GPT

If you're interested in exploring the notebooks further, I've uploaded the data files in a folder called `data`. Additionally, for utilizing GPT analysis, you'll need an API key for OpenAI models.

Feel free to explore, experiment, and contribute to these projects! If you have any questions or suggestions, don't hesitate to reach out. Thank you for visiting! ðŸš€
